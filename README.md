___
1. What is a namespace?
    - They are used to organize the classes in namespace
2. What are value types?
    - Value types are specifics of a variable and carry specifics of that variable. Such as int 32
3. What are reference types?
    - These are variables such as class, String, object, etc. 
4. What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
    - Makes property decleration more concise wihtout any extra logic. 
5. What is the purpose of using statement?
    - Provides a convenient syntax that ensures the correct use of IDisposable objects. such as using system.IO
6. What are dynamic type variables?
    - It is a type that avoids compile time type checking. 
7. What is the purpose of the is operator?
    - When you use the is operator you are checking the object type and it returns a bool value
8. What are generics and how is using them useful?
    - Generics specify data type of programming elements in a class or a method. Generics allow you to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance. 
9. What is the scope of a public member of a class?
    - The public member of a class can be accessed by all data types and type members. 
10. Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

12. What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?

13. What is an enumeration?
    - Enumarable types are a set of named interger constants such as Gender as we have done. 
14. What is inheritance?

15. Is multiple inheritance supported?
    - Yes it is
16. What is the purpose of as operator

18. What is the difference between a struct and a class?
    - Structs are value types and classes are reference types. Structs are stored on the stack and classes are stored on the heap. There are many other differences but these are the main ones. 
19. What is the difference between continue and break statements?
    - You can use the continue or break statements when using a while loop. 
20. What is this and how is it used?
    - This. is used to refer to the current instance of the class. Such as this.name or this.type.
21. What is try and catch and when are they used?
    - they are loops. try will go through the loop and read for any exception erros or encapsulate a region of a code and
22. How is exception handling done?
    -
23. What is finally and what is its purpose?
    -
24. List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
    -
25. What is an object?
    -
26. Define constructor.
    -
27. When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
    -
28. What is an abstract class?
    -
29. What is an interface?
    -
30. What is a method?
    -
31. What is a property?
    -
