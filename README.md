# CsharpQuestions
___
1. What is a namespace?
    - They are used to organize the classes in namespace
2. What are value types?
    - Value types are specifics of a variable and carry specifics of that variable. Such as int 32
3. What are reference types?
    - These are variables such as class, String, object, etc. 
4. What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
    - Makes property decleration more concise wihtout any extra logic. 
5. What is the purpose of using statement?
    - Provides a convenient syntax that ensures the correct use of IDisposable objects. such as using system.IO
6. What are dynamic type variables?
    - It is a type that avoids compile time type checking. 
7. What is the purpose of the is operator?
    - When you use the is operator you are checking the object type and it returns a bool value
8. What are generics and how is using them useful?
    - Generics specify data type of programming elements in a class or a method. Generics allow you to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance. 
9. What is the scope of a public member of a class?
    - The public member of a class can be accessed by all data types and type members. 
10. Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
    - Yes
11. How do you sort an array?
    - You can use the Array.sort()
12. What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
    - They allow to to assign null to value type variables. 
13. What is an enumeration?
    - Enumarable types are a set of named interger constants such as Gender as we have done. 
14. What is inheritance?
    - Inheritance can create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from an existing class.
15. Is multiple inheritance supported?
    - Yes it is
16. What is the purpose of as operator
    - The as operator uses certain types of conversions between compatible reference types and even nullable types.  
17. What is an object?
    - An object is an instance of a class that is created dynamically such as Cat or Dog we created. 
18. What is the difference between a struct and a class?
    - Structs are value types and classes are reference types. Structs are stored on the stack and classes are stored on the heap. There are many other differences but these are the main ones. 
19. What is the difference between continue and break statements?
    - You can use the continue or break statements when using a while loop. 
20. What is this and how is it used?
    - This. is used to refer to the current instance of the class. Such as this.name or this.type.
21. What is try and catch and when are they used?
    - they are loops. try will go through the loop and read for any exception erros or encapsulate a region of a code and
22. How is exception handling done?
    - Whenever you do a try or while loop you want to have exception handling. If anything fails you can display an eroor message instead of the program just crashing. 
23. What is finally and what is its purpose?
    - When the try/catch blcok executes the finally block will always execute it whether its an exception or if it just executes normally. It's main purpose is to release the system resources
24. List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
    - An array is a set list or collection of data that has a fixed or unchanged length that cannot be changed during runtime. An array list is an array that you can store same or different data types. An array list can also accept null types as well. The size of an array list can increase or decrease at any moment.
25. What is an object?
    - Once more, an object is just an instance of a class. 
26. Define constructor.
    - A constructor usually initialize the data members of the new object. It takes no parameters. 
27. When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
    - var can be used for any variable called and the system will automtically initate what type of variable it is. 
28. What is an abstract class?
    - An abstract class is a special kind of class that is usually created only to be sub-classed
29. What is an interface?
    - When you create an interface you are creating a set of methods. It helps provide a way to make aclass into two classes.
30. What is a method?
    - A method is a code block that contains different kinds of statements. 
31. What is a property?
    - A property or properties helps read and write the value of a private field. 
32. What is an access specifier?
    - Access specifier describes the scope of accessibility of an object and everything in it. 
33. What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
    -public: can be accessed from anywhere private: limited only inside the classes or struct in which they are declared       protected:limited within the class or struct and the class derived from this certain class internal: can be accessed within the program that conatins the decleration
34. What is a collection?
    - classes that serve various purposes. 
35. What is a Hash Table?
    - used when you need to access elements from using key.
